( all tests took so long because of the pandemic and I had to go all the way to London for the termination because they would t do it in Wales) the wait was horrendous and I had absolutely NO after care. 

We then tried again 6/7 months later and I insisted that I had a NIPT assessment done as soon as possible.. this was done at 9/10 weeks.( This should be offered to every mum and shouldnåt be an optional test after a high risk is presented around 14/15 weeks at the quad testing. )

I am now 36 week and am due early December, winter! Plus Covid! Plus Christmas month. A lot of risk again. So I am hoping for the best birth experience possible but setting my expectations bar to low. 

I find the current methods of carrying my own pregnancy file very old fashioned and totally out of date. What if that got lost??? Is there an easy accessible paperless option? Would also have to save me repeating myself at every appointment that is my Second Pregnancy- first baby. This breaks my heart every time.

I was not prepared for many of my symptoms (early cramping for 2 weeks, extreme fatigue etc). I would not say I enjoy being pregnant and I would like time to fly and for the baby to be born. I hear wonderful stories about people enjoying being pregnant but I've generally been uncomfortable, anxious and tired. 

I feel that there is definitely not enough support for pregnant women during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. I was extremely frightened at the pain I was feeling and the doctors/midwives kept telling me they were unable to help until I was at a certain stage in the pregnancy. I felt very abandoned and unsupported.

I did have to go to the EPU at week 9 and I have no negative things to say about this department. They took me seriously and listened to my worries and were extremely happy to be able to give me good news (which is not always the case for them). I am also very happy now that my midwives are able to support me - I have two wonderful midwives who are kind and supportive. I just wish that they could have been assigned to me when I most needed it.

I have also had mixed experiences during scans/consultant appointments. My 12 week scan was carried out by a lady that I felt was very cold and did not explain what was happening. My first consultant appointment left me in tears and very frightened and fat shamed without giving me proper information or advice other than to diet (which I believed was not what I was meant to do while pregnant) - and it turned out I was under the wrong consultant anyway after I burst into tears at reception and was helped by a wonderful midwife. My 20 week scan was carried out by two lovely, very kind and informative women and made me feel very at ease. My next consultant appointment was with a male doctor who was very kind and supportive and made me feel very reassured. My follow up 20 week scan was carried out by the same lady as the 12 week scan and the baby was in the wrong position but she kept huffing and puffing and made me feel like it was my fault.

I understand that this has been in place for some time but it makes no sense as we are pregnant during that time and they can do things to support your pregnancy. It feels as those they donåt bother in case you miscarry and thereås nothing they can do anyway which is pretty poor. I was referred to prams due to severe anxiety which is now worse due to threat of early labour and the earliest they can see me in March despite feeling suicidal at the thought of anything bad happening to my baby. I am currently admitted to singleton due to tightenings and positive test showing I will go into labour. They have explained these can be inaccurate however I have had conflicting information in the last 24 hours. One midwife said Iåd have scans and be here at least 48 hours as they would expect labour to happen within first two days of the test, the consultant said happy to let me go today even though Iåm still having tightenings. I will stay for 48 hours but makes it so hard doing the right thing. I was also put on a ward with two women in labour while trying to prevent mine which was completely distressing. Other than that singleton have been a huge support when no other services were willing to be, particularly EPU who recognised my anxiety and even arranged a reassurance scan for me. "
