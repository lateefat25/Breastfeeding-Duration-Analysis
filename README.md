# Breastfeeding-Duration-Analysis
Welcome to the Breastfeeding Duration Analysis project repository! This project aims to investigate the factors influencing the length of the breastfeeding period using statistical analysis techniques.

# Overview:
Breastfeeding is crucial for infant health and maternal well-being. Understanding the factors that affect breastfeeding duration is essential for promoting maternal health and informing public health policies. This project explores the impact of relationship status and working hours on the length of the breastfeeding period.

# Key Findings:
##vRelationship Status: 
Individuals living with a partner or in a married relationship tend to have longer breastfeeding periods compared to those who are single or separated.

## Working Hours: 
Working individuals, particularly those with flexible schedules or self-employment, often experience shorter breastfeeding periods.

# Methodology:
The analysis employs Cox regression modeling to examine the relationship between various factors and breastfeeding duration. Hazard ratios and p-values are utilized to quantify the impact of relationship status and working hours on breastfeeding duration.

# Usage:
Feel free to explore the code, data, and findings presented in this repository. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

# About:
This project was undertaken as part of the ACME Software Lab internship program under the guidance of PAUL EMUROTU. It demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, statistical modeling, and interpretation of results.
